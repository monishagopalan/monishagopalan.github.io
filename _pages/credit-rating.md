title: Machine Learning Models for Corporate Credit Rating Forecasts
permalink: /projects/credit-rating

---

Corporate credit ratings play a pivotal role in assessing a company's ability to meet its debt obligations. Credit rating agencies, such as Moodys, Fitch, and Standard and Poors, conduct thorough evaluations based on financial indicators extracted from balance sheets. These assessments are crucial for companies issuing bonds, providing investors with insights into a corporation's creditworthiness.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build predictive models capable of forecasting the credit rating that a company will receive. The insights gained can aid financial analysts, investors, and companies in making more informed decisions related to credit risk.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle [Corporate Credit Rating](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agewerc/corporate-credit-rating/data).
This dataset comprises 2029 credit ratings assigned by major agencies to prominent US firms traded on NYSE or Nasdaq. The ratings span the period from 2010 to 2016. Each entry encompasses 30 features, with 25 being financial indicators.
