Here is a snapshot of my experiences and my <a href="/assets/documents/MonishaGopalan_Resume.pdf" >Resume</a>

## Work Experience

### Visual Data Scientist 
<a href="https://www.arpm.co/about">Advanced Risk and Portfolio Management</a>, Milan, Italy | _April 2024 - Now_ <br>
- Contributing to the ARPM e-platform by writing Python code to implement case studies in quantitative finance and advanced data science concepts, such as optimal transport,  and creating visualizations to enhance teaching material.
- Completed the mathematically rigorous ARPM Quant Bootcamp and Data Science Foundations course as part of professional training.


### AI Scientist - Intern 
<a href="https://www.ipazia.com">Ipazia</a>, Milan, Italy | _March 2023 - January 2024_ <br>
<a href="/assets/documents/reco-ipazia.pdf" >Reference Letter</a>

- Analysed large-scale time-series datasets and implemented LSTM and Transformer models for optimizing portfolios, using PyTorch Lightning and AWS SageMaker.
- Worked on a scikit library for portfolio optimisation [skportfolio](https://github.com/scikit-portfolio/scikit-portfolio).
- Engaged in pioneering research to develop a novel architecture, incorporating Hopfield layers for portfolio optimisation, contributing to a peer-reviewed publication - [ICAIF'24: Hopfield Networks for Asset Allocation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3677052.3698605)
- Explored emerging areas like extreme multilabel classification and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification.

### Master's Thesis Student 
University of Padova, Italy | _November 2022 - March 2023_ <br>
<a href="/assets/documents/reco-unipd.pdf" >Reference Letter from Thesis Advisor</a>

- Explored Real Space Renormalization Group Techniques for lattice systems.
- Implemented Monte Carlo methods for renormalization group studies.

### Master's Thesis Student
Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru | _November 2018 - July 2019_

- Modelled Phase-Field for Eutectoid Transformation in Ternary systems.
- Developed a C program for numerical analysis and growth constant variation.
