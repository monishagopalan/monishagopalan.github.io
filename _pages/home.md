I am Monisha Gopalan, 27 years old, originally from India, currently living in Italy. I hold **dual master's** degrees in STEM, having earned my Bachelor of Science (Research) degree from the esteemed **Indian Institute of Science**, a university consistently [ranked #1](https://www.nirfindia.org/2023/ResearchRanking.html) in India for its research contributions. Securing a place in their highly interdisciplinary program stands as a significant achievement, considering that only 120 out of 1.5 million high school graduates attain this distinction. Following the completion of my Master's degree in Materials Science at the same institution, I relocated to Italy to pursue a Master's in Physics at the **University of Padova**.

Characterizing myself as inherently curious and quick to grasp new concepts, I consider my ability to delve to the core of a problem/concept my greatest strength. Having had the opportunity to study abstract mathematical courses like Topology and Group Theory and advanced physics courses like Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity, I find satisfaction in understanding phenomena through mathematical explanations. I adopt a critical approach to learning by posing questions to myself and scrutinizing alternatives. My enthusiasm extends to the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge and I highly appreciate how concepts from different domains can be harnessed to solve a particular problem. I am fascinated by the dynamic world of programming and it has been a consistent companion throughout my academic journey. 

My recent role as an AI Scientist, where I worked on Deep Learning methods for Portfolio Optimisation, got me really excited about the opportunities to use my skills in Quantitative Finance and Data Science. 

## Career Objectives

While my initial inclination was towards academia and research, my perspective has evolved, and I now recognize similar and more impactful opportunities in the industry that align with my goals. I am eager to channel my skills and knowledge into endeavors where I can contribute meaningfully. 

> I am actively seeking opportunities in Europe, starting in February 2024, for roles such as Data Scientist, Quantitative Analyst and other similar positions in the fields of finance and data science.

## Hobbies

I love getting creative with art and crafts. In grade 5, I even won a national award for my handwriting! I've kept that skill alive through calligraphy. I also enjoy cooking (and eating) food from different cuisines.
