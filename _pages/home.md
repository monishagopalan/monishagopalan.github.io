I am Monisha Gopalan, 27 years old, orginally from India, currently living in Italy. I hold **dual master's** degrees in STEM, having earned my Bachelor of Science (Research) degree from the esteemed **Indian Institute of Science**, a university consistently [ranked #1](https://www.nirfindia.org/2023/ResearchRanking.html) in India for its research contributions. Securing a place in their highly interdisciplinary program stands as a significant achievement, considering that only 120 out of 1.5 million high school graduates attain this distinction. Following the completion of my Master's degree in Materials Science at the same institution, I relocated to Italy to pursue a Master's in Physics at the **University of Padova**.

Characterizing myself as inherently curious and quick to grasp new concepts, I consider my ability to delve to the core of a problem/concept my greatest strength. Having had the opportunity to study abstract mathematical courses like Topology and Group Theory and advanced physics courses like Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity, I find satisfaction in understanding phenomena through mathematical explanations. I adopt a critical approach to learning by posing questions to myself and scrutinizing alternatives. My enthusiasm extends to the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge, appreciating how concepts from different domains can be harnessed to solve a particular problem. My recent role as an AI Scientist, where I worked on Deep Learning methods for Portfolio Optimisation, got me really excited about the opportunities to use my skills in Quantitative Finance and Data Science.

While my initial inclination was towards academia and research, my perspective has evolved, and I now recognize similar and more impactful opportunities in the industry that align with my goals. I am eager to channel my skills and knowledge into endeavors where I can contribute meaningfully. 

> I am actively exploring opportunities in Europe, starting in February 2023, for roles such as AI Scientist,Quantitative Analyst and other similar positions in the fields finance and data science.

## Hobbies

I love getting creative with art and crafts. In grade 5, I even won a national award for my handwriting! I've kept that skill alive through calligraphy. I also enjoy cooking (and eating) food from different cuisines.
